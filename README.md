# Genetic Sequence Classification

## Project Overview
This project is about classifying genetic sequences using machine learning. It includes loading and preprocessing DNA sequence data, converting it into numerical form, training classification models, and evaluating their accuracy.

## Objectives
- Analyze and prepare genetic sequence data.
- Build machine learning models for sequence classification.
- Evaluate and compare model performance using accuracy and other metrics.
